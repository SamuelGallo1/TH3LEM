TH3LEM (_IPA:θɹˈiːləm_) is a theoretical computer architecture based on 3-level-logic created by an Computer science Tech Student.  
The name stands for **Theoretical 3-level machine** or **Theoretical 3-level machine architeture** as Th3lema (a pun for the religion) 
...inspired by MARIE and Malbolge and more...to finish.

# Introduction  
As said in the **History** part Th3lem is based on a three-value-logic with the simplicity of MARIE...math...logic and more...to finish.
